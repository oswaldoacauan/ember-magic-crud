## Setting up your magic-cruds

After you have everything installed and ready to go, it is time to start coding.
in order for you to have a magic crud working, you need 3 things:

1. Some data to display in the table, for instance a `Model`
2. A `Route` that mixin the `magic-route` addon's `Mixin`
3. A `Controller` with the table and form definitions

#### Here is how your `Routes` should look like:

```javascript
/* app/routes/person.js */
import Ember from 'ember';
import MagicRoute from 'ember-imdt-magic-crud/mixins/magic-route';

export default Ember.Route.extend(MagicRoute, {});

/* app/routes/person/add.js */
import Ember from 'ember';
import MagicRoute from 'ember-imdt-magic-crud/mixins/magic-route';

export default Ember.Route.extend(MagicRoute, {});

/* app/routes/person/edit.js */
import Ember from 'ember';
import MagicRoute from 'ember-imdt-magic-crud/mixins/magic-route';

export default Ember.Route.extend(MagicRoute, {});

```

#### Also, edit your router in order for the parameters to match the route

```javascript
import Ember from 'ember';

Router.map(function() {
  this.route('person', function() {
    this.route('add');
    this.route('edit', {path:'edit/:id'});
  });
});

export default Router;

```

#### Here is how your `Controller`
```javascript
/* app/routes/person.js */
import Ember from 'ember';

const{
  A
} = Ember;

export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  tableOptionsMC: new A([{
    contentPath: 'id',
    columnTitle: 'Id'
  },
  {
    contentPath: 'name',
    columnTitle: 'Name'
  },
  {
    contentPath: 'template',
    columnTitle: 'Actions',
    template: 'custom/table-actions',
    isSortable: false
  }]),

  formDefinitionsMC: [
    {
      attribute: 'model.name',
      label: 'Name',
      type: 'text',
      validations:{
        presence: true,
        length: {minimum: 3}
      }
    },
    {
   	  attribute: 'model.description',
      label: 'Description',
      type: 'text',
      validations:{
      	presence:true
      }
    }
  ]
});

```

Thats it, you have a fully functional Crud for a model.
